BASILICATA
A little hot always needs a little cool. That was our philosophy when we created the Basilicata, a pizza that balances the robust kick of our spicy sausage and Italian-style hot peppers with the healthy cool of saut√©ed spinach. Our herbed olive oil base provides the perfect platform for these complementary flavours to live in harmony.
